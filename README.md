# Score Counter Remote Control
This is an Android app which serves as a remote control for a custom HW - Score Counter and Clock on a LED display https://github.com/jankechm/BLE-Score-Counter-Display which uses Bluetooth Low Energy for communication.
It provides score manipulation functionality including setting it's orientation and also configuration for the LED display brightness and setting which information is displayed on the display and how (alternating vs. scrolling).

This project is written in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose. There's also a previous version which uses XML views https://github.com/jankechm/BLE-Score-Counter-Remote-Control
